        This application is part of a research project aiming to evaluate the benefits of simultaneously using several network paths such as WiFi and cellular on your iPhone. The tests will evaluate two transport protocols: Multipath TCP and Multipath QUIC. The outcome of the tests is available in the "Results" section of the application. This enables you to figure out if your networks behave well with those protocols.
        
        This application collects network metadata. Those metadata will only be used for research purposes. MultipathTester does not collect any personal information and never will.
